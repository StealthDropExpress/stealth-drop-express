But in reality, anyone can wear any color they choose, regardless of gender. With the rise of gender-neutral fashion, it's time to break free from these outdated ideas and explore the world of color in all its glory. Here's our guide to color pairing that anyone can use to elevate their fashion game.","theme.clothiers.33-unisex-guide-text-paragraph-c":"Start with the basics. Before diving into the world of bold color combinations, it's important to have a solid foundation of basic colors in your wardrobe. Black, white, grey, and navy are all versatile and timeless colors that pair well with anything. Once you have a good mix of these basics, you can start experimenting with more colorful pieces.","theme.clothiers.33-unisex-guide-text-paragraph-d":"Stick to complementary colors. Complementary colors are those that sit opposite each other on the color wheel. For example, blue and orange, red and green, and yellow and purple are all complementary pairs. When paired together, complementary colors create a striking contrast that can be both bold and harmonious.","theme.clothiers.33-unisex-guide-text-paragraph-e":"Experiment with monochromatic looks. Monochromatic outfits are made up of different shades and tints of the same color. For example, a navy sweater paired with light blue jeans and navy shoes creates a cohesive and stylish look. Monochromatic outfits are easy to put together and can be a great way to add depth and interest to your wardrobe.","theme.clothiers.33-unisex-guide-text-paragraph-f":"Mix warm and cool tones. Warm colors, like red, orange, and yellow, have a fiery and energetic feel, while cool colors, like blue, green, and purple, have a calming and soothing effect. By mixing warm and cool tones, you can create a balance of energy and tranquility in your outfits. For example, a burgundy sweater paired with light blue jeans and brown boots creates a warm and inviting look.","theme.clothiers.33-unisex-guide-text-paragraph-g":"Have fun with patterns. Patterns can be a great way to add color and interest to your outfits. When mixing patterns, it's important to choose complementary colors and patterns that are different in scale. For example, a small polka dot shirt paired with a larger striped blazer creates a fun and playful look.","theme.clothiers.33-unisex-guide-text-paragraph-h":"In conclusion, color pairing is all about experimentation and having fun. Don't be afraid to mix and match colors and patterns to create your own unique style. With these tips in mind, you'll be well on your way to creating stylish and gender-neutral outfits that showcase your personality and individuality.","theme.clothiers.34-slow-response-banner-date":"July 6, 2023","theme.clothiers.35-slow-response-banner-headline":"A slow response to fast fashion.","theme.clothiers.36-slow-response-text-paragraph-a":"We're taking a closer look at the impact of this trend and why slow fashion is more important than ever.","theme.clothiers.36-slow-response-text-paragraph-b":"Fast fashion has been a topic of debate for years, with many experts and activists highlighting the negative impact it has on the environment and the workers who make the clothes. However, despite the numerous critiques and calls for change, the trend of fast fashion seems to only be getting stronger. In this post, we're exploring why this is the case and why slow fashion is more important than ever.","theme.clothiers.36-slow-response-text-paragraph-c":"One of the reasons why fast fashion has continued to thrive is its affordability. With prices so low, consumers are able to purchase more clothes than ever before, leading to a culture of overconsumption. This culture is fueled by the constant pressure to keep up with the latest trends and to always have something new to wear. Unfortunately, this mindset often means that clothes are only worn a few times before being thrown away, adding to the already massive amount of textile waste in landfills.","theme.clothiers.36-slow-response-text-paragraph-d":"Another factor that contributes to the popularity of fast fashion is the lack of transparency in the industry. Most consumers have no idea where their clothes come from, who made them, or under what conditions. This lack of information makes it easy for companies to exploit workers and to engage in environmentally harmful practices without fear of being held accountable.","theme.clothiers.36-slow-response-text-paragraph-e":"Despite the challenges, there are some positive signs of change. The rise of slow fashion, which prioritizes ethical and sustainable practices, has gained momentum in recent years. More and more consumers are becoming aware of the negative impact of fast fashion and are looking for alternative ways to shop. This has led to an increase in the number of sustainable and ethical brands, as well as a growing interest in secondhand shopping.","theme.clothiers.36-slow-response-text-paragraph-f":"In conclusion, while fast fashion continues to dominate the industry, it's important to remember that there are other options. Slow fashion offers a more ethical and sustainable approach to fashion, one that values quality over quantity and puts people and the planet first. By supporting sustainable and ethical brands, and by making more conscious choices about what we wear and how we shop, we can all play a part in creating a more just and sustainable fashion industry.","theme.clothiers.37-spring-2023-banner-date":"July 6, 2023","theme.clothiers.38-spring-2023-banner-headline":"The spring 2023 lookbook is here.","theme.clothiers.39-spring-2023-text-paragraph-a":"Spring is in the air and we're excited to unveil our latest collection in The Clothiers Spring 2023 Lookbook.

Ethical and sustainable fashion starts at the source\u2014the fabric. By opting for fabrics that are responsibly and ethically produced, we can contribute to a more just and eco-friendly fashion industry.

Fabrics made from recycled materials reduce waste and contribute to a circular economy. Additionally, choosing fabrics with certifications such as Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS) or Bluesign\xAE ensures that they have been manufactured under stringent environmental and social criteria.

Fast fashion has been a topic of debate for years, with many experts and activists highlighting the negative impact it has on the environment and the workers who make the clothes. However, despite the numerous critiques and calls for change, the trend of fast fashion seems to only be getting stronger. In this post, we're exploring why this is the case and why slow fashion is more important than ever.

One of the reasons why fast fashion has continued to thrive is its affordability. With prices so low, consumers are able to purchase more clothes than ever before, leading to a culture of overconsumption. This culture is fueled by the constant pressure to keep up with the latest trends and to always have something new to wear. Unfortunately, this mindset often means that clothes are only worn a few times before being thrown away, adding to the already massive amount of textile waste in landfills.

Another factor that contributes to the popularity of fast fashion is the lack of transparency in the industry. Most consumers have no idea where their clothes come from, who made them, or under what conditions. This lack of information makes it easy for companies to exploit workers and to engage in environmentally harmful practices without fear of being held accountable.

Despite the challenges, there are some positive signs of change. The rise of slow fashion, which prioritizes ethical and sustainable practices, has gained momentum in recent years. More and more consumers are becoming aware of the negative impact of fast fashion and are looking for alternative ways to shop. This has led to an increase in the number of sustainable and ethical brands, as well as a growing interest in secondhand shopping.

In conclusion, while fast fashion continues to dominate the industry, it's important to remember that there are other options. Slow fashion offers a more ethical and sustainable approach to fashion, one that values quality over quantity and puts people and the planet first. By supporting sustainable and ethical brands, and by making more conscious choices about what we wear and how we shop, we can all play a part in creating a more just and sustainable fashion industry.`,"theme.olive-gloria.50-lookbook-banner-date":"May 10, 2023","theme.olive-gloria.51-lookbook-banner-headline":"The spring lookbook is here.","theme.olive-gloria.52-lookbook-text-paragraph1":"Spring is in the air and we're excited to unveil our latest collection in our Spring Lookbook.","theme.olive-gloria.53-lookbook-text-paragraph2":"Check it out.","theme.olive-gloria.54-lookbook-text-paragraph3":`The long-awaited arrival of spring means that it's time to refresh our wardrobes with new and exciting pieces.

To start, gather an assortment of fresh flowers. Choose a variety of blooms in different shapes, sizes, and colors to create visual interest. Popular choices include roses, lilies, daisies, and baby's breath for filler. Ensure that your flowers have been properly hydrated by trimming their stems at an angle and placing them in water for a few hours before arranging.

Next, select a focal flower or two that will be the centerpiece of your bouquet. Arrange them at different heights, cutting their stems at varying lengths to add dimension. Surround these focal flowers with complementary blooms, staggering them for a balanced look. Don't forget to include some greenery like eucalyptus or ferns to add texture and depth. As you add each element, secure the bouquet with floral tape, wrapping it tightly around the stems. Finally, cover the tape with a decorative ribbon or twine, leaving a few inches of stems exposed for a polished finish. Trim any excess stems to achieve your desired bouquet length, and voil\xE0 \u2013 you've created a stunning floral arrangement!
